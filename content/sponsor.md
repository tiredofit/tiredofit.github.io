You must have come here from some work I have done in open source. The work I release to the public is based on my own personal needs and many times providing enhancements based on feedback of otheres using my solutions. 

If yiou like what I do, sponsoring my work will get quicker updates, priority bug fixes, and more likelyhood for features that were not apart of my needs to be built.

Presently I am only accepting via [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tiredofit).
