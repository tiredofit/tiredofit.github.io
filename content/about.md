### Hi

I'm Dave, living on an island in the far west of Canada. It's nice here.

I'm a seasoned technology professional focussing specifically on infrastructure deployment and assisting medium sized enterprises to gain control of their data and assets. After leaving the IT industry in the 2000s to take a near decade long sojourn by bicycle around the world, I find myself back in the industry with an entirely different viewpoint.

I haven't hosted a personal website for many years, and I'm not quite sure where I plan on taking this, so, if you were looking for anything more exciting, my apologies, and perhaps later.
