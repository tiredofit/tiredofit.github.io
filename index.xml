The work I release to the public is based on my own personal needs and many times providing enhancements based on feedback of others using my solutions.
If yiou like what I do, sponsoring my work will get quicker updates, priority bug fixes, and more likelyhood for features that were not apart of my needs to be built.</description></item><item><title>Work with me</title><link>https://tiredofit.github.io/work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 03:28:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://tiredofit.github.io/work/</guid><description>sponsor me</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://tiredofit.github.io/contact/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 03:28:51 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://tiredofit.github.io/contact/contact/</guid><description>You can send me an email to dave at this domain&amp;rsquo;s name :)</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://tiredofit.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 03:28:46 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://tiredofit.github.io/about/</guid><description>Hi I&amp;rsquo;m Dave, living on an island in the far west of Canada. It&amp;rsquo;s nice here.
I&amp;rsquo;m a seasoned technology professional focussing specifically on infrastructure deployment and assisting medium sized enterprises to gain control of their data and assets. After leaving the IT industry in the 2000s to take a near decade long sojourn by bicycle around the world, I find myself back in the industry with an entirely different viewpoint.</description></item></channel></rss>
